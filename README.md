# Professional README Generator  

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description 

Taking user input for a command-line prompt, a professional README will be generated for a project based on user answers to questions provided by the NPM Inquirer

## Table of Contents

-- [Installation](#installation)

-- [Usage](#usage)

-- [License](#license)

-- [Contributing](#contributing)

-- [Tests](#tests)

-- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
  
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

    npm i

## Usage

In order to save time during a project's construction, invoking "node index.js" to run the file will prompt the questions to appear in the terminal. Once those questions are answered, a professional README.md file will be created for use with that project. License can be picked as well, which will display a badge at the top of the README and provide a link to the proper license page.
